# Lexical-decision-task

This assignment has amendments to two different task scripts in it. 

First, Assignment 7 code is interspersed throughout delay discounting task script from the LectureDD.py script (Lecture 6), downloaded from the course Canvas website and also uploaded here. 

Second, the assignment submission for the delay discounting dataset from Lecture 7 can be found beneath. This assignment was performed based on the understanding that “summarize” means “take the average of” (or “generally calculate summary statistics for,” from which mean was chosen). The original script, DelayDisc_example.csv for Assignment 7 for the delay discounting task from Lecture 7 (conducted in Google Colab at this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M7IJkcKYkCV9D3LiBIqgFvaGneJvV_A4#scrollTo=9eec29ce-2d1a-45f5-b5c3-e113dde35437) can be found at this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinLloyd/Psychology_Programming2025/refs/heads/main/Data/DelayDisc_example.csv (also accessible through this path: https://github.com/CaitlinLloyd/Psychology_Programming2025/tree/main/Data.)

Alterations to each original script were made to accomplish the same goal: to summarize the reaction time for the delay discounting task (for each person) according to whether a right or left response was made by a given participant.

To run each of the amended scripts, paste these portions of amended script in to the respective scripts. Load the amended LectureDD.py in PsychoPy, and hit "Run." Download from GitHub and load the amended DelayDisc_example.csv into PsychoPy, and hit "Run."
