# Delay_Discounting_task

This assignment has two different Python scripts in it.

First, Assignment 7 code is interspersed throughout delay discounting task script from the LectureDD.py script (Lecture 6), downloaded from the course Canvas website and also uploaded here. 

Second, the assignment submission for the delay discounting dataset from Lecture 7 can be found beneath. 

This assignment was performed based on the understanding that “summarize” means “take the average of” (or “generally calculate summary statistics for,” from which mean was chosen). The dataset, DelayDisc_example.csv for the delay discounting task from Lecture 7 (conducted in Google Colab at this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M7IJkcKYkCV9D3LiBIqgFvaGneJvV_A4#scrollTo=9eec29ce-2d1a-45f5-b5c3-e113dde35437) can be found at this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaitlinLloyd/Psychology_Programming2025/refs/heads/main/Data/DelayDisc_example.csv (also accessible through this path: https://github.com/CaitlinLloyd/Psychology_Programming2025/tree/main/Data.)

Alterations to the original LectureDD.py script and writing of the script for the DelayDisc_example.csv dataset were made to accomplish the same goal: to summarize the reaction time for the delay discounting task (for each person) according to whether a right or left response was made by a given participant.

To run each of the scripts, paste the first portion of amended script in to the LectureDD.py script. Load the amended LectureDD.py in PsychoPy, and hit "Run." Download from GitHub and save the script for the DelayDisc_example.csv dataset as a .py file, load it into PsychoPy, and hit "Run."
